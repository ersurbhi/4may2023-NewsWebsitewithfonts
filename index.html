        <img src="./img/1.png">
        <p>Uttarakhand tunnel collapse: The 41 workers would lie on low, wheeled stretchers that would be pulled out of the horizontal chute using ropes.</p>
        <p>Drilling through the rubble to prepare an escape route for the 41 workers trapped inside the Silkyara tunnel in Uttarakhand's Uttarkashi resumed on Friday morning, a day after another snag hit the rescue efforts. The workers will be pulled out on wheeled stretchers one by one through a big pipe.</p>
        <p>Earlier on Friday morning, former advisor to the Prime Minister's Office Bhaskar Khulbe said boring through the rubble with an auger would resume by 11.30am and the operation might successfully be completed by the evening if everything goes well.</p>
        <p>The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) earlier on Friday demonstrated how the stretchers will be used to pull out the trapped workers.</p>
